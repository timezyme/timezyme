## Purpose

This test suite was created to prevent regression of critical features (authentication and database integrity) after a database deletion incident. It provides quick feedback to ensure these systems remain functional during development.

---

*Created in response to: "During a previous working session claude code deleted my db... Can you create a set of simple tests that we can run after every task to ensure features and functionality we've worked hard to complete are still intact"*

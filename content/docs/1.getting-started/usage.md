## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating your first Zyme - transforming a simple document into an engaging visual story. By the end, you'll understand the core workflow and be ready to explore advanced features.

## What We'll Create

We'll transform a sample research paper about climate change into an interactive timeline with data visualizations. This example showcases TimeZyme's ability to:
- Extract key dates and events
- Visualize data and statistics
- Create interactive navigation
- Add engaging animations

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### 1. Prepare Your Document

For this tutorial, you can use any document, but we recommend starting with:
- A research paper or article (5-10 pages)
- Content with clear sections or chapters
- Some data points or statistics
- A chronological element (dates, timeline, process)

For best results, ensure your document has clear headings and well-structured content. TimeZyme's AI works better with organized information.

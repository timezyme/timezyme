Last Updated: July 19, 2025
1. Introduction

Welcome to TimeZyme. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we collect, use, and safeguard your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices for our website, APIs, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).

This policy is designed to help you understand:

    What information we collect and why we collect it.

    How we use that information and our policy on AI model training.

    The choices you have about your information.

By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
2. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide, maintain, and improve our Services. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our Services.

2.1. Information You Provide to Us

    Account Information: When you create a TimeZyme account, we collect information such as your name, email address, and password. For paid subscriptions, we collect payment information, which is processed by our third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe). We do not store your full credit card details.

    Your Input: We collect the documents, text, and any other content you upload, submit, or otherwise provide to the Services to be transformed into Zymes ("Input").

    Communications: If you contact us directly for support or other inquiries, we may receive additional information about you, such as the contents of your message and any attachments you may provide.

2.2. Information We Collect Automatically

    Usage and Log Data: We automatically collect information about your interactions with our Services. This includes technical data like your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, and the dates and times of your requests.

    Zyme Interaction Data: We collect information about how you interact with Zymes and the Knowledge Graph. This includes which Zymes you create, view, or share, and the links you follow between ZymeNodes. This specific navigational data forms your unique "Graph Trail."

    Cookies and Similar Technologies: We use cookies and similar technologies to operate and administer our Services, gather usage data, and improve your experience. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of our Services.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for several purposes, all aimed at providing and enhancing your experience with TimeZyme.

    To Provide and Maintain the Services: We use your Input to generate Zymes and your Zyme Interaction Data to build and personalize your Knowledge Graph. Your Graph Trail is used to power features like proactive Zyme suggestions and your personal "My Zyme Map."

    To Improve and Develop Our Services: We analyze usage data to understand how our Services are used, which helps us troubleshoot issues, develop new features, and improve the overall user experience.

    To Communicate With You: We use your contact information to send you service-related announcements, updates, security alerts, and support messages.

    For Safety and Security: We use information to protect against fraud, abuse, and security risks. This includes verifying accounts and monitoring for suspicious activity.

    To Comply with Legal Obligations: We may use your information where required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or other legal process.

4. Our Policy on AI Model Training

User trust is the foundation of our platform. Our policy on using data for AI model training is designed to be clear and protective of your intellectual property.

    For Paid Subscriptions (Pro, Team, Enterprise): We do not use your Input or the content of your generated Zymes to train, retrain, or otherwise improve our or any third-party's generative AI models. Your content is used exclusively to provide the Services to you.

    For Free Tiers: For users of any free tier of our Services, we may use your Input and the resulting Zymes to improve our Services, which may include training our AI models. Where this is the case, we will provide you with clear notice and, where feasible, an option to opt-out.

    Anonymized Interaction Data: We may use anonymized and aggregated Zyme Interaction Data (which does not include the substantive content of your Input or Zymes) to analyze trends and improve the core functionality of our platform, such as the quality of the Knowledge Graph connections.

5. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:

    With Your Consent: We may share your information with your consent, for example, if you choose to share a Zyme with another user or make it public.

    Third-Party Service Providers: We work with third-party vendors and service providers to help us operate, secure, and improve our Services. These include payment processors, cloud hosting providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), and analytics services. These providers have access to your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated to protect your information under strict confidentiality agreements.

    Third-Party AI Models: To provide the Services, your Input may be processed by third-party AI models. We have contractual agreements with these providers that prohibit them from using your Input for their own purposes or for training their models, consistent with our commitments in Section 4.

    Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.

    Business Transfers: If TimeZyme is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as a business asset. We will provide notice before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

6. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services.

You can delete your account at any time through your account settings. When you delete your account, we will take steps to delete your personal information and Input from our active systems. Please note that some information may remain in our backup archives for a period of time for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.
7. Your Data Rights and Choices

You have rights and choices regarding your information. Depending on your location, these may include:

    Access and Update: You can review and update your account information through your account settings.

    Data Portability: You may have the right to request a copy of the information we hold about you in a structured, machine-readable format.

    Deletion: You can request the deletion of your account and associated data as described in Section 6.

    Object to Processing: You may have the right to object to our processing of your personal information under certain circumstances.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@timezyme.com.
8. Security

We take the security of your information very seriously. We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to maintain the security of your data. This includes using encryption for data in transit and at rest and restricting access to personal information to employees and contractors who need to know that information to process it for us.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
9. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States and other locations where we or our service providers operate.
10. Children's Privacy

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email, through the Services, or by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

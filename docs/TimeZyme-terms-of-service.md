1.2 Agreement
These Terms, along with our Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy, form the entire agreement between you and TimeZyme. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this complete legal framework.
2. Description of the TimeZyme Services

TimeZyme provides a sophisticated AI-powered platform that transforms dense, static documents and other forms of Input into interactive, multi-layered knowledge objects called Zymes. The Services are designed to help users understand complex information more efficiently by allowing for progressive disclosure of detail and nonlinear exploration.

Each Zyme you create becomes a ZymeNode within a broader, dynamic Knowledge Graph. This graph connects documents, concepts, entities, and events, enabling you to discover novel connections and navigate an interconnected web of insights. The Services may utilize proprietary AI models as well as technologies and models from third-party providers to deliver these functionalities.

The Services are constantly evolving. We reserve the right to modify, add, or remove features and functionalities at our discretion.
3. Eligibility and User Accounts

3.1 Age Requirement
You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Services. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction), you may only use the Services with the permission and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. The Services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13.

3.2 Account Registration and Security
To access most features of the Services, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.

You are solely responsible for safeguarding your account password and for any and all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you have authorized such activities. You agree to notify TimeZyme immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. Sharing individual account credentials with others is strictly prohibited.
4. Subscriptions, Fees, and Payment

4.1 Service Tiers
TimeZyme offers various service tiers, which may include a free version with limited functionality and paid subscription plans ("Subscriptions") such as "Pro" and "Enterprise" tiers. The specific features, limits, and pricing for each tier are described on our pricing page.

4.2 Billing and Payment
For paid Subscriptions, you agree to pay all applicable fees as described on our pricing page. You authorize us to charge your chosen payment method (e.g., credit card) on a recurring basis for your Subscription. All payments are processed through a secure third-party payment processor; TimeZyme does not store or have access to your full payment card details.

4.3 Automatic Renewal and Cancellation
Subscriptions will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the original subscription term, unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the current term. You may cancel your Subscription at any time through your account settings. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be refunded for any fees paid for the current term, except where required by law.

4.4 Taxes and Late Fees
All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, which you are responsible for paying. We will charge tax when required to do so. Any fees not received by the due date may be subject to a late fee of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
5. Intellectual Property and Content Rights

This section outlines the ownership and rights related to the content you provide and the content the Services generate. These terms are designed to protect your intellectual property while enabling us to provide the Services.

5.1 Your Input
You retain all ownership rights, title, and interest in and to your original Input. We claim no ownership over the documents or materials you provide to the Services.

By submitting Input to the Services, you grant TimeZyme a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to access, use, host, store, process, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works of your Input. This license is granted for the sole and specific purpose of operating, providing, maintaining, and improving the Services for you. This includes generating Zymes from your Input and connecting them within your personalized Knowledge Graph. This license terminates when you delete your Input or your account, subject to system back-ups and legal retention requirements.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you own your Input or have obtained all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to submit it to the Services and to grant us the license described above; and (ii) your Input and our use of it to provide the Services will not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third party's intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or any applicable law or regulation.

5.2 Our Output (Zymes)
As between you and TimeZyme, and to the extent permitted by law, you own the Zymes generated by the Services specifically from your Input ("Output"). You are free to use your Zymes for any lawful purpose, including commercial use, subject to your compliance with these Terms and the Acceptable Use Policy.

Notwithstanding your ownership of the Output, TimeZyme retains all ownership rights, title, and interest in and to the Services themselves. This includes our underlying AI models, algorithms, software, the structural design of Zymes, the Knowledge Graph architecture, and all associated intellectual property rights. Your ownership of a Zyme does not grant you any rights to the underlying technology used to create it.

5.3 Acknowledgment of Output Similarity
You acknowledge that due to the nature of generative artificial intelligence, the Output you receive may not be unique. Other users who provide similar or identical Input may receive the same or a similar Zyme from the Services. You agree that you will not have any claim against TimeZyme or any other user for the generation or use of similar or identical Output.

5.4 Policy on AI Model Training
Building and maintaining user trust is paramount. Our policy on AI model training is designed to be clear and protective of your data.

For all users on paid "Pro," "Team," or "Enterprise" Subscriptions, TimeZyme makes the following commitment: We will not use your Input or the content of your generated Zymes to train, retrain, fine-tune, or otherwise improve our or any third-party's generative artificial intelligence models.

For users of any free tier of the Services, we may use your Input and Output to improve our Services, including for model training, unless you are provided with and utilize an option to opt-out.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, TimeZyme may collect and use anonymized or aggregated data about your interaction with the Services. This includes telemetry data such as feature usage patterns, click-stream data, and user-provided feedback (e.g., ratings or error reports). This interaction data, which does not include the substantive content of your Input or Zymes, is used for analytics, troubleshooting, and to improve the performance and quality of our Services. Our use of this data is governed by our Privacy Policy.
6. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

Your use of the Services must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy, which is provided in full below and incorporated here by reference. The AUP outlines prohibited activities, including unlawful conduct, technical misuse, and the generation of harmful or infringing content.

Violation of the AUP constitutes a material breach of these Terms and may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your account and access to the Services.
7. Third-Party Services and Models

The Services may integrate with or utilize services and AI models provided by third parties. When you use our Services, your Input may be processed by these third parties. We will only share your data with such third parties to the extent necessary to provide the Services and will ensure they are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection obligations consistent with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

TimeZyme is not responsible for the actions, policies, or failures of any third-party service provider. Your use of the Services constitutes your consent to the use of these third-party services.
8. Confidentiality

This section applies primarily to users on Enterprise Subscriptions or as otherwise agreed upon in a separate agreement.

Each party (the “Receiving Party”) agrees to keep confidential all non-public information and materials provided by the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) that are marked as confidential or that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential (“Confidential Information”). For the User, Confidential Information includes your non-public Input. For TimeZyme, Confidential Information includes our non-public technology, product roadmaps, and security information.

The Receiving Party will protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care it uses for its own similar information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party will not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except as permitted by these Terms or with the Disclosing Party's prior written consent.
9. Data Privacy and the Knowledge Graph

Your privacy is critically important to us. Our collection, use, and protection of your personal data are described in detail in our Privacy Policy.

You specifically acknowledge that the Services generate a unique form of data known as the Graph Trail, which maps your navigation through the Knowledge Graph. This data is used to provide personalized and proactive features. Our Privacy Policy provides further details on how this data is handled and what controls you have over it.
10. Term, Termination, and Suspension

These Terms will remain in effect until terminated by either you or TimeZyme.

You may terminate this agreement at any time by canceling your Subscription and ceasing to use the Services.

TimeZyme reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services, with or without notice, if we believe in our sole discretion that you have violated these Terms or our AUP, or if your use of the Services poses a security risk or may cause harm to TimeZyme, our systems, or other users.

Upon termination, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. We will follow our data retention policies, as described in the Privacy Policy, to delete your Input and account data. Any fees owed to TimeZyme prior to termination will remain due and payable.

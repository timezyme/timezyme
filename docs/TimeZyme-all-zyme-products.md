## Grouping Strategy

Instead of individual extensions for each document type, I'd recommend **categorical groupings** that can handle multiple related document types:

### Proposed Extension Categories

**business_corporate**: Business Reports, Financial Analyses, Annual Reports, Corporate Strategy, Market Trends, Competitor Analyses, Press Releases, etc.

**legal_regulatory**: Legal Briefs, Cases, Contracts, Patent Applications, Regulatory Filings, Compliance Guidelines, IP Filings, etc.

**technical_engineering**: Product Manuals, Technical Specs, Blueprints, Manufacturing Processes, IT Infrastructure, Software Roadmaps, etc.

**financial_investment**: Investment Portfolios, Fund Prospectuses, Funding Rounds, Grant Proposals, Risk Assessments, etc.

**government_policy**: Policy Papers, Government Documents, Legislative Updates, Climate Reports, Public Health Studies, etc.

**media_communications**: News Articles, Blog Posts, Press Releases, Conference Summaries, Webinar Highlights, Magazine Articles, etc.

**organizational_hr**: Employee Handbooks, HR Policies, Meeting Minutes, Performance Reviews, Training Materials, etc.

**planning_strategy**: Development Plans, Project Timelines, Event Agendas, Marketing Strategies, Partnership Proposals, etc.

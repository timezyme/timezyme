Analytics Cookies

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us understand which pages are the most and least popular, see how visitors move around the site, and identify performance issues. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance.

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages (e.g., a customer support chat widget). If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.

These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.

What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

Cookies help us remember information about your visit, which can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Here are the main types of cookies we use:

    First-party vs. Third-party Cookies: First-party cookies are set by TimeZyme directly. Third-party cookies are set by our partners and service providers, such as analytics or advertising networks.

    Session vs. Persistent Cookies: Session cookies are temporary and expire once you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them. They are used to remember your preferences for subsequent visits.

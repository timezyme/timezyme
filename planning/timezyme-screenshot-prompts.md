## 1. Intelligent Dashboard
**Category:** Overview  
**Description:** Your command center for document transformation and knowledge discovery

### Image Prompt:
"Create a modern, dark-themed web application dashboard screenshot. The interface should feature a sleek command center with multiple panels showing: document processing status cards with progress bars, a knowledge graph visualization in the corner, recent activity feed, and analytics widgets displaying insights extracted from documents. Use a color scheme of dark gray backgrounds with cyan/teal accents. Include subtle gradients and glass-morphism effects. The UI should look professional and data-rich, suggesting AI-powered document intelligence."

## 2. Simple Document Upload
**Category:** Getting Started  
**Description:** Drag and drop any document - PDFs, Word docs, presentations, and more

### Image Prompt:
"Design a clean drag-and-drop file upload interface screenshot. Show a large, centered upload zone with a dashed border and a glowing cyan outline. Include icons for various file types (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.) floating above the drop zone. Display a 'Drag files here or click to browse' message. Add subtle animation indicators like uploading progress bars for some files. Use a dark theme with gray backgrounds and bright cyan accents for interactive elements. Make it look intuitive and welcoming."

## 3. Timeline View
**Category:** Zyme Views  
**Description:** See chronological events and key dates extracted from your documents

### Image Prompt:
"Create a sophisticated timeline visualization interface showing events extracted from documents. Display a horizontal timeline with multiple tracks, showing different categories of events. Include date markers, event cards with brief descriptions, and connecting lines. Use color coding for different event types. Add a zoom slider and navigation controls. The design should be dark-themed with cyan highlights for selected items. Show both past and future events, with the current date prominently marked. Make it look like an advanced document analysis tool."

## 4. Mind Map Visualization
**Category:** Zyme Views  
**Description:** Explore concepts and relationships in an interactive knowledge map

### Image Prompt:
"Design an interactive mind map interface showing interconnected concepts extracted from documents. Display a central node with multiple branches radiating outward, each representing different topics or themes. Use varying node sizes to indicate importance. Show relationship lines between connected concepts with labels. Include a sidebar with node details. Use a dark background with nodes in various shades of cyan, teal, and blue. Add subtle animations or glow effects to suggest interactivity. The overall look should be organic yet structured."

## 5. Knowledge Graph
**Category:** Advanced Features  
**Description:** Discover connections across your entire document library

### Image Prompt:
"Create a complex 3D knowledge graph visualization showing document relationships across a library. Display numerous interconnected nodes representing documents, concepts, and entities. Use different node shapes for different types (documents as rectangles, concepts as circles, people as diamonds). Show relationship edges with varying thickness based on connection strength. Include a search bar and filter controls. Use a dark space-like background with nodes glowing in cyan, blue, and purple. Add depth with perspective and clustering of related items."

## 6. Progressive Layers
**Category:** Core Features  
**Description:** Dive from high-level summaries to detailed analysis with L0-L3 layers

### Image Prompt:
"Design a layered document analysis interface showing progressive detail levels. Display a split-screen or tabbed interface with L0 (executive summary), L1 (key points), L2 (detailed sections), and L3 (full analysis) tabs. Show the same document content at different granularity levels. Use visual hierarchy with font sizes and opacity to indicate depth. Include toggle buttons to switch between layers. Use a dark theme with cyan accents for active layers. Add visual indicators showing how information flows between layers."

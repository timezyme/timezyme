### 📝 Feature Overview

- **Problem Statement:** Need to verify that the test suite and linting configuration set up by another process is accurate, follows best practices, and functions correctly.
- **Solution Vision:** Comprehensive verification of test suite setup, identifying and fixing any issues with E2E tests, and ensuring linting configuration follows established best practices for Nuxt applications.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - All E2E tests pass without errors
  - `pnpm test:e2e` and `pnpm test:e2e:ui` commands work correctly
  - Linting configuration follows best practices
  - No linting errors when running `pnpm lint`

### 👥 User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to verify the test suite is properly configured so that I can run tests reliably
2. As a developer, I want to ensure linting exceptions are appropriate so that code quality standards are maintained
3. As a developer, I want to confirm E2E tests can be executed via standard commands so that testing is consistent

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- **UI / UX:**
  - E2E test UI (Playwright UI mode) launches correctly
  - Test results are clearly visible and actionable
- **Performance:**
  - Tests complete within reasonable timeframes (< 10 seconds for critical tests)
  - Linting runs quickly without hanging
- **Accessibility:** N/A for this internal tooling verification
- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Test credentials remain secure and are not exposed in logs
  - No sensitive data is included in test outputs

### 🔧 Technical Requirements

- **Architectural Approach:** Verification and correction of existing test infrastructure
- **Data-Model / Schema Changes:** None required
- **API Endpoints (if any):** N/A
- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  - Playwright for E2E testing
  - ESLint with @antfu/eslint-config preset
- **Key Security Considerations:**
  - Test credentials stored securely in fixtures
  - Authentication flow properly tested
- **Middleware Requirements:** N/A
- **Navigation/Redirect Logic:** Verify protected route redirects in tests
- **Icon/Asset Dependencies:** N/A
- **UI Component Library:** N/A

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** N/A (focusing on E2E test verification)
- **Integration / E2E Tests:**
  - Fix failing tests due to strict mode violations
  - Ensure all 13 critical tests pass
  - Verify test commands work correctly
- **Manual QA Checklist:**
  - Run `pnpm test:e2e` and verify execution
  - Run `pnpm test:e2e:ui` and verify UI mode
  - Run `pnpm lint` and check for errors
  - Run `./scripts/post-task-verify.sh` for comprehensive check
- **Performance / Load Tests:** N/A
- **Development Server Testing:** Verify dev server on port 9009
- **Browser Testing with Playwright:**
  - Fix strict mode selector issues
  - Test with Chromium browser
  - **Test Credentials:**
    - demo-user@nuxtstarterkit.com / demoUserNuxtStarterKit
    - demo-admin@nuxtstarterkit.com / demoAdminNuxtStarterKit0815#
- **Test Script Location:** All test scripts in `/scripts` directory
- **Screenshot Documentation:** Playwright configured to capture on failure

### 📋 Implementation Plan

| Phase | Description | Estimated Effort | Dependencies / Risks |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 0     | Verify dev environment & test existing functionality | S | Dev server already running |
| 1     | Fix E2E test strict mode violations | M | Multiple elements matching selectors |
| 2     | Verify linting configuration best practices | S | Already passing, just needs review |
| 3     | Test all commands and scripts | S | Ensure compatibility |
| Final | Run linting & fix all issues | S | Code style compliance |

### ❓ Open Questions

- Should we add more specific selectors to avoid strict mode violations?
- Are there any additional test scenarios that should be covered?
- Should the linting rules be more or less strict for this project?

### 🚀 Definition of Done

- [ ] All E2E tests pass without errors
- [ ] `pnpm test:e2e` command executes successfully
- [ ] `pnpm test:e2e:ui` launches Playwright UI correctly
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes without errors
- [ ] Test suite documentation is accurate
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in test runs
- [ ] `./scripts/post-task-verify.sh` passes all checks

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] Not fixing strict mode violations properly
- [ ] Breaking existing test functionality
- [ ] Changing linting rules that might affect team standards
- [ ] Not verifying all test commands work
- [ ] Forgetting to clean up test artifacts

## Current Findings:

1. **Test Suite Structure**: Well-organized with 13 critical tests covering authentication, payments, and admin functionality
2. **E2E Test Issues**: Tests are failing due to Playwright strict mode violations (multiple elements matching selectors)
3. **Linting Configuration**: Properly configured with @antfu/eslint-config and passes without errors
4. **Test Commands**: Both `test:e2e` and `test:e2e:ui` are properly configured in package.json

### Key Issues to Fix:

1. **Strict Mode Violations in E2E Tests**:
   - Multiple input elements with `name="email"` on login page
   - Multiple buttons matching login/sign in pattern
   - Tests need more specific selectors

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Update test selectors to be more specific (use data-testid or unique selectors)
   - Verify all test helpers and fixtures are working correctly
   - Ensure test isolation and proper cleanup

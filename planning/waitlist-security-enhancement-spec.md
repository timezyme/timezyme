### üìù Feature Overview

- **Problem Statement:** The current waitlist implementation lacks essential security measures including rate limiting, CSRF protection, and protection against bot submissions and disposable emails, making it vulnerable to abuse.
- **Solution Vision:** Enhance the existing waitlist functionality with comprehensive security measures including rate limiting, CSRF protection, honeypot fields, disposable email detection, and robust E2E testing to ensure a production-ready, secure waitlist system that protects against spam, bots, and malicious activity.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 95%+ reduction in bot submissions
  - Zero security vulnerabilities in OWASP testing
  - <5% bounce rate from invalid emails
  - 100% E2E test coverage for critical flows
  - <500ms form submission response time

### üë• User Stories

1. As a legitimate user, I want to join the waitlist easily without intrusive security measures so that I can be notified when the product launches
2. As a site administrator, I want protection against bot submissions and spam so that our waitlist contains only genuine interested users
3. As a developer, I want comprehensive security measures that are easy to maintain so that the application remains secure without constant monitoring
4. As a security auditor, I want the waitlist to follow OWASP best practices so that user data is protected and the system is resilient to attacks

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- **UI / UX:**
  - Form submission remains smooth with <500ms response time
  - Clear error messages for rate limiting (e.g., "Too many attempts. Please try again in X minutes")
  - No visible honeypot fields to legitimate users
  - Loading states during submission
  - Success confirmation with next steps

- **Performance:**
  - Rate limiter uses efficient in-memory caching
  - Email validation happens asynchronously
  - No blocking operations during form submission
  - Graceful degradation if external validation services fail

- **Accessibility:**
  - Honeypot field properly hidden from screen readers
  - Error messages announced to assistive technologies
  - Form remains keyboard navigable
  - Clear focus indicators maintained

- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Rate limiting prevents more than 3 submissions per IP per hour
  - CSRF tokens validated on every submission
  - Disposable email domains blocked
  - Honeypot field catches automated submissions
  - All user inputs sanitized and validated
  - No sensitive data logged

### üîß Technical Requirements

- **Architectural Approach:**
  - Leverage existing nuxt-security module for rate limiting
  - Add nuxt-csurf for CSRF protection
  - Create custom email validation utilities
  - Implement honeypot field with CSS hiding
  - Use server-side validation as primary defense

- **Data-Model / Schema Changes:**
  - No changes to existing waitlist table schema
  - Add rate limit storage using unstorage (in-memory LRU cache)

- **API Endpoints (if any):**
  - Enhance `/api/waitlist/subscribe` with security measures
  - No new endpoints required

- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  - Optional: Email validation API for enhanced detection
  - Built-in disposable domain list as fallback

- **Key Security Considerations:**
  - Never trust client-side validation alone
  - Log security events for monitoring
  - Implement graceful degradation
  - Use secure session storage for CSRF tokens

- **Middleware Requirements:** 
  - Rate limiting middleware (route-specific for `/api/waitlist/*`)
  - CSRF middleware (global for all POST/PUT/PATCH requests)

- **Navigation/Redirect Logic:** 
  - No redirects needed for waitlist functionality
  - Error states handled inline within the form

- **Icon/Asset Dependencies:** 
  - Loading spinner (existing in Nuxt UI)
  - Success/error icons (existing in Nuxt UI)

- **UI Component Library:** Nuxt UI - [Documentation](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started)

### üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Email validation utility functions
  - Disposable domain detection
  - Rate limiting logic

- **Integration / E2E Tests:**
  - Complete signup flow with valid email
  - Rate limiting behavior (multiple rapid submissions)
  - CSRF token validation
  - Honeypot field effectiveness
  - Disposable email rejection
  - Email verification flow

- **Manual QA Checklist:**
  - [ ] Form submits successfully with valid email
  - [ ] Rate limiting kicks in after 3 attempts
  - [ ] CSRF protection blocks requests without tokens
  - [ ] Honeypot field is invisible to users
  - [ ] Disposable emails are rejected
  - [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
  - [ ] Loading states work correctly
  - [ ] Email verification link works

- **Performance / Load Tests:**
  - Simulate 100 concurrent submissions
  - Verify rate limiter performance under load
  - Check memory usage of LRU cache

- **Development Server Testing:**
  - Test with demo emails: test@test.com
  - Verify rate limiting resets after timeout
  - Check honeypot with browser dev tools
  - Test CSRF with and without tokens

- **Browser Testing with Playwright:**
  - Happy path: successful signup
  - Rate limiting: rapid submissions
  - Bot simulation: filled honeypot
  - CSRF validation: missing token
  - **Test Credentials:** test@test.com / 12345678

- **Test Script Location:** All test scripts MUST be placed in the `/scripts` directory, never in the project root
- **Screenshot Documentation:** Use Snap-Happy MCP server to capture visual states during testing

### üìã Implementation Plan

### ‚ùì Open Questions

- Should we integrate a third-party email validation API or use built-in detection only?
- What's the preferred rate limit threshold (currently proposing 3/hour)?
- Should we track metrics on blocked submissions for analysis?
- Do we want to implement CAPTCHA as an additional layer?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- [ ] Not testing with actual user credentials before implementing
- [ ] Assuming middleware names match file names (e.g., 'auth' vs 'auth.global.ts')
- [ ] Using client-side navigation functions incorrectly (navigateTo vs window.location)
- [ ] Not checking for port conflicts when running dev server
- [ ] Forgetting to verify icon availability in the UI library
- [ ] Not considering the order of operations in async authentication flows
- [ ] Trusting client-side validation alone
- [ ] Making honeypot field visible to screen readers
- [ ] Not handling rate limit edge cases (IP changes, shared networks)
- [ ] Forgetting to test with JavaScript disabled

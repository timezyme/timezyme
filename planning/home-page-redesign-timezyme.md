# Home Page Redesign - TimeZyme Branding

## üìù Feature Overview

- **Problem Statement:** The current home page needs to be updated to match the modern, dark-themed design shown in the reference screenshot while maintaining the existing navigation elements and functionality.
- **Solution Vision:** Transform the home page into a modern, dark-themed landing page with gradient effects, centered content, and the TimeZyme branding. The design will use Nuxt UI Pro components with TailwindCSS 4 styling while preserving all current navigation links and authentication states. The new design will feature a purple/magenta gradient theme, centered hero content with a "Transform Reading into Understanding" tagline, and a prominent "Join Waitlist" CTA button. The footer will be redesigned to match the reference with Quick Links and Company sections.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Clean, modern dark-themed design matching the reference
  - Maintained navigation functionality
  - Responsive design working on all screen sizes
  - No broken authentication flows
  - All existing tests passing

### üìù Feature Overview

- **Problem Statement:** The current /help page has four static cards that don't provide any functional value or meaningful content. With investor review approaching and the TimeZyme app several months from release, we need to transform this page into a strategic asset that demonstrates preparation, vision, and professionalism.

- **Solution Vision:** Transform the help page into an interactive "TimeZyme Academy" - a pre-launch knowledge hub that educates visitors about the problem TimeZyme solves, showcases our domain expertise, provides valuable content for our target audience (researchers/academics), and builds anticipation for the full product launch. Each card will link to carefully crafted content that serves both investor due diligence and user education purposes.

- **Success Metrics:**
  - Investor engagement time on help-related pages (target: >2 minutes)
  - Click-through rate from help cards (target: >30%)
  - Waitlist conversions from help content (target: >10%)
  - Positive investor feedback on preparedness and user focus

### üë• User Stories

1. As an investor, I want to see that TimeZyme has thoroughly planned their user support strategy so that I can be confident in their operational readiness.

2. As a potential user visiting pre-launch, I want to understand how TimeZyme will transform my research workflow so that I can decide whether to join the waitlist.

3. As an academic researcher, I want to see content that demonstrates TimeZyme understands my pain points so that I trust they can solve my problems.

4. As a Google funding team member, I want to evaluate TimeZyme's preparation for scale so that I can assess their readiness for growth.
